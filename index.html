        Korotkevich was born in Gomel (Homiel), southeastern Belarus.
        His parents, Vladimir and Lyudmila Korotkevich, 
        are programmers in the mathematics department at 
        Francysk Skaryna Homiel State University. At age 6, he became 
        interested in his parents' work. When he was 8, his father 
        designed a children's
        game he could use to learn programming<br>

        Korotkevich first gained global attention when he qualified for the
        2006 International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) at the age of 11,
        a world record by a large margin<br>

        He took the silver medal at his first IOI event and received gold medals
        from 2007 to 2012. To date, he is the most successful competitor in IOI's history<br>

        At the 2009 IOI in Plovdiv, the then 14-year-old Korotkevich said of his success,
        "I try various [strategies], and one of them is the right one. I am no genius.
        I am simply good at it." He said he spent no more than three to four hours each 
        day at the computer, and his preferred hobbies are football and table tennis.<br>
